We will treat all such information obtained or accessed by us during the audit as confidential information pursuant to this EULA for use by us only as necessary to ensure compliance with and enforcement of the terms of this EULA. If any audit reveals that you have underpaid license, maintenance and support or subscription Fees, you will be invoiced for all such underpaid Fees based on our list price in effect at the time the audit is completed.
